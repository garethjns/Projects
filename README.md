Animals and humans integrate sensory information over time, and combine this information across modalities in order to make accurate and reliable decisions in complex and noisy environments. 
Most previous examples of multisensory enhancement have relied on synchrony dependent mechanisms, but these mechanisms alone are unlikely to explain the entire scope of multisensory integration and perceptual object formation, particularly between senses such as vision and hearing, which process multidimensional stimuli and operate with different latency constraints.

Temporal synchrony and spatial congruency are two important cues for perceptual object formation and and recent studies have shown that humans and animals are more flexible with regards to temporal constraints than traditionally believed. This project aims to investigate the flexibility of the spatial constraints informing object formation and its neural correlates.

In mammals, integration of information between modalities is assumed to occur in higher (parietal, frontal) areas  of the brain, implying independent, unisensory processing chains that are combined later on. However, multisensory inputs to primary sensory cortices, particularly visual inputs to auditory cortex, are common. The function of these inputs is unknown, but it is possible they contribute to integration at an early stage of processing. Drift diffusion models of decision making can be used to model unisensory evidence accumulation with time, and extended to emulate both "early" and "late" integration systems.

The TM is the most complex acellular membrane in the body and is an important mechanical component of the mammalian cochlea. It exhibits similarly complex mechanical properties that change as it is vibrated at different acoustic frequencies. In collaboration with Steve Elliott at the University of Southampton, UK we developed a novel frequency-dependent model of the TM's viscoelastic (sheer storage modulus and sheer viscosity)  material properties. We found that the frequency dependence is generally lost when the structure of the TM is disrupted by genetic mutations found in humans families exhibiting hearing loss. 

The frequency dependence of these properties add additional degrees of freedom yet to be included in models of the cochlea.

### Optogenetic stimulation of mammalian out-hair cells (Brighton)
Successful insertion of light-sensitive ion channels into cochlear outer hair cells has the potential to create a alternative, higher resolution mechanism of stimulation for hearing prosthesis compared to current electrical cochlear implants. In collaboration with the University of Memphis, USA, this project attempted to induce movement in *in vitro* hair cells with channelrhodopsin channels using laser light, and to detect this movement using existing laser interferometry techniques.

### Acoustic sensitivity of the mammalian vestibular system (Sussex)
**Publications:** [JARO, 2010](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cU1sBXcAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=cU1sBXcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), [Thesis, 2012](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cU1sBXcAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=cU1sBXcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C)  
The hearing range of mammals varies greatly between species, with some adapted to hear very high frequency sound. This mechanically limits the lower frequency range of the cochlea, however. This project used behavioural methods to find evidence that the sacculus - an evolutionary old inner ear organ designed to detect gravity - may be able to detect lower frequency sounds. This saccular input affects the sensation of sound and enhances sub-conscious reactions such as the acoustic startle reflex and represents an unusual case of "multi"-sensory integration.
